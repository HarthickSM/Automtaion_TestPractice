Automating E-Commerce Workflows with Selenium
Goal:
• Automate the process of searching, filtering, extracting, and verifying
product information on e-commerce platforms like Flipkart or
Amazon.
Steps:
1 .Open the browser and navigate to the website.
2 .Use Selenium's locators (e.g., By-name, By.cssSelector) to interact with elements like search boxes, filters, etc.
3 .Extract product details using lists of web elements and retrieve textproperties.
4 .Add a product to the cart and verify success through element visibility.

Highlights:
• Dynamically handle pop-ups or multiple tabs.
• Efficiently locate and interact with specific elements using XPath/CSSelectors.
• Use proper waits (Thread.sleep, WebDriverWait) for seamless navigation.

Outcome:
• Save time and ensure consistent e-commerce functionality testing.
